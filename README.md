## Features

- Window Management: Utilizes GLFW for creating and managing windows, handling user input, and managing the rendering loop.

- Swap Chains: Implements Vulkan swap chains for efficient frame presentation and rendering.

- Command Buffers: Uses command buffers to record and execute rendering commands.

- Vertex Buffers: Manages vertex buffers for storing vertex data and rendering 3D models.

- Push Constants: Supports push constants for efficient data transfer between the CPU and GPU.

- Transformations: Provides functionality for transforming and translating game objects within the scene.

- Keyboard Input: Allows for camera movement and control using keyboard inputs.

- 3D Model Loading: Capable of loading and rendering 3D models in various formats.

- Diffuse Shading: Implements diffuse shading to achieve realistic lighting effects.

- Specular Lighting: Supports specular lighting to add highlights and reflections.

- Uniform Buffers: Utilizes uniform buffers for performance optimization and efficient data management.

- Point Lights: Implements point lights for dynamic lighting effects, including billboarding for visual enhancement.
